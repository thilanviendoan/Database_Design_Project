# Database_Design_Project
## **aSFashion Database Design & Implementation**

**Project Overview:**
This project was part of my **Database Design** course, where I implemented a database system for a retail company called **aSFashion**. The project involved:
- Creating a relational database schema from an ER diagram
- Writing SQL scripts to create tables, insert test data, and execute queries
- Generating reports for management using complex SQL queries

**Files:**
- `Create.txt`: SQL script for creating the database and its tables.
- `Insert.txt`: SQL script to insert test data into the tables.
- `Query.txt`: SQL script containing several queries to generate reports for management.

**Key Features:**
- **Database Creation:** Tables created based on a given ER diagram and schema.
- **Data Insertion:** Inserted at least 5 records per table to ensure queries returned meaningful results.
- **Complex Queries:** 
  - List of staff sorted by salary.
  - Retrieve the second-oldest customer order.
  - Show store names, manager names, and hourly rates.
  - Generate a list of products sold and their quantities.
  - Additional queries for advanced database manipulation.

**How to Run the Project:**
1. Run the `Create.txt` to create the database.
2. Use the `Insert.txt` file to populate the tables with test data.
3. Use `Query.txt` to execute the required queries and generate reports.
